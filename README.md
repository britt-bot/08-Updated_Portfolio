# 08-updated_portfolio
## Description 
This is an updated version of previous project assignment, Homework 02 - Portfolio that was "completed" 02/13/2021. 

This newer version, Homework 08 - Updated Portfolio, was "completed" 04/03/2021. 

I will continue to work and improve this page as the course and time continues. I am in love with tinkering with the way things work to make it look certain ways. 

I can't wait to just see what I end up able to do and what new things I figure out to add/adjust on this, so I can keep looking back on it, as I grow into a 

Full Stack Web Developer. This is my way of showing what I am capable of and then some, so I have to make this amazing. It might take a minute, but I have it in me.
